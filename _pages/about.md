Welcome! I'm Md Habibur Rahman, a researcher with a passion for solving engineering problems through data, experimentation, and thoughtful design.

What I Do
======
I focus on applying scientific rigor to real-world challenges, from designing experiments and analyzing complex datasets to building tools that make research more reproducible. My work spans academic research, technical writing, and mentoring, all grounded in a drive to make an impact through clear communication and reliable results.

About Me
